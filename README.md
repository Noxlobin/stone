# Stone Theme

This is a theme that is a copy from Midnight with a few changes from my own color palette. Feel free to use it, steal it, and do whatever you want with it. Installing it is pretty easy.

1. `BetterDiscord`
   Take stone.theme.css and drag it into your themes folder.

2. `Vencord`
   Copy `INSERT LINK HERE` into the themes input box.

Thats all I know. This project is not maintained because it was never meant to. So if you wanted to send a issue, fuck off
